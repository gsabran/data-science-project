      "-\"What factors are affecting the spread of the epidemic?\"\n",
      "-\"Do gaps exist in ETC locations in relation to recent isolated outbreaks?\"\n",
      "-\"Are the ETCs appropriately used and resourced when taking the results from predictive analysis of the outbreak into consideration?\" \n",
      "-\"Will a lower CFR have a significant economic impact on communities?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "LONG-TERM\n",
      "-\"Can we locate communities not directly affected by the outbreak but are economically suffering?\"\n",
      "-\"can we predict food prices if the outbreak continues at the current trajectory?\"\n",
